Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace

For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be

I believe in God the Father Almighty,
  Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,
  Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
  Born of the Virgin Mary,
  Suffered under Pontius Pilate,

He descended into hell;
  The third day he rose again from the dead;

He ascended into heaven,
  And sitteth on the right hand of God
    the Father Almighty;
From thence he shall come to judge
