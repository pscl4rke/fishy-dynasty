Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace
  according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles
  and to be the glory of thy people Israel.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
  and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be
  world without end.
